# The Danebook

The Danebok is a social media site with all the features we have come to expect. Make a secure account, search for friends by name, build your social network and share posts and photos. Once you said what's on your mind, like and comment on your friends' activities. 

### Technologies

This is made using Ruby On Rails (rails version 5), CSS3 with Flexbox, and Twitter Bootstrap.
